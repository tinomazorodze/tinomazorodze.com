              I was using a Dell G3 GeForce 1050 prior to this and the
              difference is night and day. Iâ€™ve never heard the fans turn on a
              single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it
              through with our various launch simulations.

              For some reason I always find myself opening the notepad app to do
