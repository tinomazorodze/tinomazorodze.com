# Work

<AnimatedName />

On a mission to improve the [internet tech industry in Zimbabwe](/n/software-in-zimbabwe) and Africa at large. Here's a summary of my work so far.

## IB Global

<Small>President of Product, 2023 - present</Small>

I started developing IB as a personal blog about Zimbabwe. The goal was to build a neat blog which provided well crafted articles about the country.

Later on in 2024 having found people to work with we expanded the blog to other African nations including ibzim.com, iblogsa.com, ibnya and more.

Now the blogs have over 20,000 monthly readers and we arw looking to keep on scaling while providing our readers the best experience.

## Study Companion

<Small>Senior Software Engineer, 2024 - present</Small>

Study Companion as the name suggests is a tool to help students to better prepare for examination. The platform is currently under development and we are looking to launch it soon.

## Zim Developers Labs

<Small>Lead Developer, 2025 - present</Small>

Zim Developers Labs is a community of developers in Zimbabwe. We are working on building a platform to help developers in Zimbabwe to collaborate and work on projects together.
