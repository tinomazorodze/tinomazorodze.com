       ### OMEN 45L, NVIDIAÂ® GeForce 4090, Core i9-13, 64GB DDR5 RAM

       I was using a Dell G3 GeForce 1050 prior to this and the difference is night and day. Iâ€™ve never heard the fans turn on a single time, even under the incredibly heavy loads I put it through with our various launch simulations.
