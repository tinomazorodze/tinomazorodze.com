# My Favourity Video Games

<AnimatedName />

Joining the online gaming world was a real life changer for me. I've met so many people and made friends from all over the world. Here are some of my favourite games:

## Dota 2

[Dota 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/) is a very popular MOBA tower defense game where 2 teams of 5 compete to destroy one another's ancients. The game involves a lot of strategizing, quick thinking and teamwork which has led me to spend hundreds of hours playing it.

## Euro Trucks Simulator 2 ([TruckersMP](https://truckersmp.com))

[ETS2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2/) is a game that I've been playing since 2018. It's a relaxing game that I play when I want to unwind and relax. I play on the TruckersMP online server which has made the game into a totally different experience.

## Software Inc

[Software Inc](https://store.steampowered.com/app/362620/Software_Inc/) is a game that I've been playing since for years now. As a software developer who likes video games its only natural that I am also into realistic Software Development simulator games like Software Inc.
