# The Software industry in Zimbabwe

<AnimatedName />

The software industry in Zimbabwe is growing exponetially. This is mostly due to the very low barrier to entry. The industry is still in its infancy and there is a lot of room for growth.

Its no secret that as a country we are years behind 1st world countries like the USA in terms of internet technology but that is not to say that we are not catching up. The industry is growing and there are a lot of opportunities for software developers in Zimbabwe.

Lucky for us learning to code is now easier than ever. There are a lot of resources available online that can help you learn to code. You can learn to code for free on websites like [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

Despite the growth there are still a lot of challenges that the industry faces. The biggest challenge is the lack of funding. Most software developers in Zimbabwe are self taught and do not have the resources to take their projects to the next level. In addition to that software doesnt really sell for much in Zimbabwe. Most people are not willing to pay for software and this makes it hard for software developers to make a living.

Even so this does not mean venturing into software is a bad idea. This is the best time to get started. The industry is still young and there is a lot of room for growth. If you are a software developer in Zimbabwe you should take advantage of the opportunities that are available to you.
